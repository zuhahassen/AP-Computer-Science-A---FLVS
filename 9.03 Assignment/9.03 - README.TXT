********************************** P M R ************************************************************************************************* 
<+s>: Understood polymorphism 
      A better understanding of creating a method that can handle objects related through inheritance
      
<-s>: I had difficulty understanding how to create an ArrayList of the objects, looking back at the example programs presented I was able to figure
out how to create an ArrayList
******************************************************************************************************************************************
In the future: I hope to make my code more efficient using polymorphism when dealing with objects of related inheritance
