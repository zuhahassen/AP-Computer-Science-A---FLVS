********************************** P  M R *************************************************************************************************

<+s>: It was easy to navigate through BlueJ and I understand how to use it. 
      Using the different print methods interchangeably was easy. 
      I had to be aware of small typos, errors pop up while compiling.
      
<-s>: I consistently forgot to format the information in the print statements, so that all the information wasn't just jumbled up together.

In the future: I hope to feel more comfortable using the BlueJ editor. I need to use the notes provided to us and refer back to them.
I want to be aware of when I need to use println() and print(). I also want to be cautious with spelling since the Java is picky with typos.
